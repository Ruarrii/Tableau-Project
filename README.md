# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
In this project I will
- turn data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau
- create an impactful dashboard
- communicate insights with the correct visualizations

## Process
### Step 1: Connecting the TB Dataset to Tableau
### Step 2: Checking and correcting data types in Tableau
### Step 3: Building visualizations to learn more about the dataset
### Step 4: Trying to find patterns, trends, outliers, etc. from the data
### Step 5: Detecting meaningful keypoints
### Step 6: Coming up with different questions that are relevant to the data
### Step 7: Creating the dashboard that will answer my questions


## Results
I chose to tackle Option 2, number 4 - Tuberculosis Burden by Country.  
My data set question was - "Which region has been impacted the greatest from TB?"  
I created six visualizations in total - a symbol map showing the average estimated prevalence of TB (all forms) by Country, a horizontal bar chart showing the estimated mortality of TB cases per 100,000 population by region per year, a line chart that forcasts the estimated number of deaths from TB from 1990 to 2016, a stacked bar chart showing the estimated prevelance of TB (all forms) by region per method used to derive estimates, a scatter plot showing the estimated incidence vs estimated prevalence of TB (all forms) per 100,000 population filtered by region, and a table showing the case detection rate in percentage by region.  
My questions and their answers were as follows:
1. Which region(s) are impacted most heavily by the estimated prevelance of TB? - South-East Asia and the Western Pacific Region have the greatest estimated prevelance of all forms of TB.
2. What trend (if any) can be seen in the mortality of TB cases? - The mortality of TB cases (excluding HIV) has seen a consistent downward trend since 1990. 
3. What does the forcast number of deaths from TB show? - The number of deaths from TB in both HIV and non-HIV positive cases is forcasted to continue to decrease from 2013 to 2016. 
4. What method is used most to estimate the prevelance of TB? - The main method used to estimate the prevelance of TB across all regions is imputed surveys. 
5. What relationship (if any) exists between the estimated incidence and estimated prevelance of TB? - The estimated incidence and the estimated prevelance of TB have a clear positive linear relationship with an R-squared of approximately 0.72 for the African region. 
6. Which region(s) have the lowest case detection rates? - Africa and South-East Asia have the lowest average case detection rates at 50.80% and 53.50% respectively. 

## Challenges 
- I need to practice more with parameters and calculated fields, I don't fully understand how to work with them.
- Overall, I'm finding graphs a little difficult to wrap my head around, which is concerning but I'll keep working at it!

## Future Goals
If I had more time I would practice more with parameters and calculated fields and improve the interactivity of my dashboard.
